 * @brief Shape policy for a cross product taken along one axis.
 *
 * The operands are broadcast together and the product is taken along one
 * axis, which survives with the extent it had. Every other axis is a batch
 * dimension, so a stack of vectors crosses with another stack, or with a
 * single vector, without any of them being written out.
 *
 * That axis must have extent three. Unlike the extents a matrix
 * multiplication contracts, this one is not a free parameter of the
 * problem: the cross product exists in three dimensions and the check is
 * what keeps a silently wrong shape from reaching a backend.
