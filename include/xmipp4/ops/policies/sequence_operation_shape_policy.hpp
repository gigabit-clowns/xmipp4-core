/**
 * @brief Shape policy for operations writing a one dimensional sequence.
 *
 * An operation of this family takes no input: what it writes is decided
 * entirely by the numbers it was built with, so its length cannot be read
 * off an operand and is a parameter instead. The caller that asked for a
 * range is the one that can work the length out from it, which is why the
 * functional layer spells it out before an operation is ever built. An
 * operation is a rigid description of work, not a request to be interpreted
 * later.
 *
 * The rank is one because that is the shape the family produces: a sequence
 * is enumerated along a single axis, and anything else is a reshape of it.
