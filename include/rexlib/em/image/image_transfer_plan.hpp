/**
 * @brief The regions transferred in one call.
 *
 * Every region pairs an offset into the file with an offset into the array,
 * and every region in a plan shares one set of extents. The two sides are
 * named for what they are rather than for which way the data moves, so
 * there is nothing to remember when a plan is built: the file side is the
 * file whether it is being read or written, and the direction belongs to
 * the call the plan is handed to, since @ref image_reader::read takes the
 * file as its source and @ref image_writer::write takes it as its
 * destination.
 *
 * The extents are the shape of one region and nothing else, so they carry
 * the rank of the region rather than the rank of either side. A side of
 * higher rank spans a single position along the axes the extents do not
 * reach, which are its leading ones: a batch of two dimensional patches is
 * cut out of a two dimensional micrograph into a three dimensional array
 * with extents of rank two, a file offset of rank two and an array offset of
 * rank three, and neither side pads the extents. Ranks may differ in either
 * direction, so a plane of a stack may equally be read into an array that
 * does not carry the axis it was stacked along.
 *
 * The shape — the extents and the two ranks — is stated when a plan is
 * constructed and never changes. A plan is therefore always one whole thing
 * rather than something to be configured before it can be used, and only the
 * regions come and go.
 *
 * The offsets are held in two @ref index_table instead of one allocation per
 * region, so a batch of any size costs a bounded number of allocations, and
 * @ref clear keeps the capacity: one instance refilled from one call to the
 * next allocates nothing after the first. That is the point of the class,
 * and reusing it is the expected way to use it.
 *
 * @ref image_transaction_plan is its peer over several files. Neither holds
 * the other.
