 * @brief How a loop's iterations are spread over the threads running it.

 * smallest slice of it worth a thread of its own. A default constructed
 * schedule runs everything on the calling thread, so a loop keeps working
 * without one and the tests driving loops directly do not have to name a pool
 * they do not care about.
 *
 * The loop entry points end in a variadic pack of operand pointers, leaving
 * no room for a trailing grain parameter, which is the other reason the pool
 * and the grain travel together as one value: it slots in ahead of the pack.
