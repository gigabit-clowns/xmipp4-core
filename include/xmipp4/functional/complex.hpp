 * @brief Obtain a view of the real part of an array.

 * Nothing is computed and nothing is allocated. A complex array is an array
 * of twice as many real values, std::complex being layout compatible with
 * an array of two of its value type, so the real parts are reachable by
 * doubling the strides. The result therefore aliases @p x, and writing
 * through it writes into @p x.
 *
 * A real array is already its own real part and is returned as a plain
 * alias.
 *
 * Being a view rather than an operation, this needs no execution context
 * and reaches no backend. Call @ref array::share_const on the result for a
 * read-only alias.
 *
 * @param x The array whose real part is viewed.
 * @return array A view of the real part of @p x.
