/**
 * @brief A completion that resolves once a fixed number of units of
 * work have all reported in.
 *
 * A semaphore-style countdown from a starting count to zero, not a
 * counter compared against a separately kept target. Resolves only
 * once every unit of work has reported, regardless of which ones
 * failed or when, so a caller of @ref completion::wait never observes
 * this ready while another unit of work behind it is still running.
 * The first exception reported, if any, is what @ref get rethrows; the
 * rest are discarded.
 *
 * Implements both @ref completion and @ref completion_notifier so that
 * the same object serves both audiences, each reached through the
 * interface meant for it: the query side goes to whoever asked for the
 * work, the notifying side goes to the @ref executor running it.
 *
 * @par Thread safety
 * @ref notify_done may be called concurrently, from as many threads as
 * the starting count.
