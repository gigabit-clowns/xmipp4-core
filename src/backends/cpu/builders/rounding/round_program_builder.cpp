/**
 * @brief Round to the nearest integer, halves going to the even one.
 *
 * std::round sends a half away from zero, so it turns 0.5 into 1 and
 * accumulates a bias upwards over a distribution. NumPy rounds halves to
 * the even neighbour instead, which cancels that bias, and this follows
 * it.
 *
 * Written out rather than deferring to std::nearbyint or std::rint, both
 * of which follow the ambient floating point rounding mode and so would
 * make the operation's result depend on state the caller might have
 * changed.
 *
 * @tparam T The floating point element type.
 * @param value The value to round.
 * @return T The nearest integer, ties going to the even one.
