// or in kernels/ when several operations share it.

/**
 * @brief Reduction kernel locating where an extremum sits.
 *
 * Covers the operations answering with the place of the largest or smallest
 * element rather than with the element itself. What separates one from
 * another is only which of two elements wins, so that is all @p Order says,
 * the way @ref fold_reduction_kernel takes only the binary fold.
 *
 * Two accumulators rather than one pair: the running extremum and the place
 * it was found are kept in separate tiles, so the comparison across the
 * outputs of a tile stays a contiguous walk of each rather than a stride
 * over interleaved fields.
 *
 * The extremum accumulates in the computation type of the operand, while the
 * answer is the index the operation's rule fixes, so neither accumulator has
 * the type of the output. Only the index is written out; the value it was
 * found at is dropped.
 *
 * Two elements neither of which displaces the other are a tie, and a tie goes
 * to the smaller linear index. The answer therefore does not depend on the
 * order the elements are visited in, which the reduced layout chooses for
 * locality, nor on the order partial answers are merged in.
 *
 * There is no identity. An extremum of nothing does not exist, and the loop
 * rejects that case rather than inventing one, as NumPy does.
 *
 * @tparam Order Whether a candidate should displace the element held,
 * invoked as `order(candidate, best)`. Must be default constructible, and
 * strict.
