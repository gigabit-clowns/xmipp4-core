	 * knows which threads the program may use, so it says so here.
	 *
	 * A program is free to ignore it and run on the calling thread. Whatever
	 * it does, the call returns only once the program has finished: the
	 * operands are spans the caller owns, and they stop being valid when
	 * `command_queue::submit` returns.
	 *
	 * @param outputs Output buffers. Neither may be null.

	 * @param scratch Workspace buffers. Neither may be null.
	 * @param pool The threads the program may spread itself over.
