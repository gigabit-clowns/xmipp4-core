 * @brief Multiply two arrays as stacks of matrices.
 *
 * The last two axes of each operand are the matrix and the rest are a
 * stack of them, broadcast between the operands. A one dimensional
 * operand is promoted for the duration, the first as a row and the
 * second as a column, and the axis added to do so is dropped from the
 * result.
 *
 * Integers are admitted: multiplying adjacency or count matrices is
 * meaningful and needs no division.
