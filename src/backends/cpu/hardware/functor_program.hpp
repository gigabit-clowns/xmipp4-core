/**
 * @brief Adapts a strongly typed functor to the @ref program interface.
 *
 * The @ref program interface is type erased: its @ref program::execute
 * method receives its operands as spans of @ref buffer handles, without any
 * static knowledge of the element types they hold. This class bridges that gap
 * by pairing a functor with compile time descriptions of its operand types.
 *
 * On @ref execute, the underlying storage of each operand buffer is obtained
 * through @ref buffer::get_host_ptr and reinterpreted according to the matching
 * entry in @p Outputs, @p Inputs and @p Scratches. The wrapped functor is then
 * invoked with three tuples of pointers to the operands' element types:
 * - Outputs and scratches are passed as pointers to mutable elements
 *   (`T *`).
 * - Inputs are passed as pointers to const elements (`const T *`).
 *
 * Because @ref buffer::get_host_ptr is used to access the storage, every
 * operand buffer must be host accessible. @ref execute throws if any of the
 * supplied buffers cannot provide a host pointer.
 *
 * A type list entry may be `void`, in which case the corresponding operand is
 * left type erased and forwarded to the functor as a `void *` (or `const void
 * *` for inputs) instead of being reinterpreted to a concrete element type.
 * This is useful for operands whose element type is not known at compile time
 * or is irrelevant to the operation.
 *
 * The order of the types within each list must match the order of the
 * corresponding buffers supplied to @ref execute, and the number of types in
 * each list must match the number of buffers in the respective span.
 *
 * @tparam F The functor to be wrapped. Must be callable with three tuples of
 * pointers to the operands' element types, in the order (outputs, inputs,
 * scratches), where output and scratch pointers are non-const and input
 * pointers are const-qualified.
 * @tparam Outputs List of output element types, one per output buffer. Must be
 * a specialization of @ref xmipp4::type_list.
 * @tparam Inputs List of input element types, one per input buffer. Must be a
 * specialization of @ref xmipp4::type_list.
 * @tparam Scratches List of scratch (workspace) element types, one per scratch
 * buffer. Must be a specialization of @ref xmipp4::type_list.
