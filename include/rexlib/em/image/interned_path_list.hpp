/**
 * @brief A list of paths in which equal paths cost one string.
 *
 * A transaction names one file per region, and the same file over and over:
 * a batch of 256 elements drawn from 8 stacks names eight distinct paths. 
 * Holding a string per entry would copy each of them as many times as it is 
 * named, so the distinct paths are held once and the entries are indices into 
 * them.
 *
 * The list therefore has two sizes. @ref get_path_count is how many distinct
 * paths were interned and @ref get_entry_count how many entries refer to
 * them, and the second is the larger one. Both are addressed separately:
 * @ref get_path takes a path index, @ref get takes an entry index.
 *
 * @ref clear keeps both capacities and the interned paths are dropped with
 * them, so one instance reused from one call to the next allocates nothing
 * after the first beyond the strings it has not seen before.
