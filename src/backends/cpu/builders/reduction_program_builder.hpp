/**
 * @brief Generic program builder for the reduction operation family.
 *
 * Builds a CPU program that folds the elements of its inputs along the axes
 * the operation names. It owns the scaffolding shared by every reduction:
 * operation type check, operand-count validation, the split of the iteration
 * space into the axes that survive and the axes being folded away, and type
 * dispatch.
 *
 * The axes are a parameter of the operation rather than of the call, so the
 * whole of that split is decided once here and the program that results holds
 * no decision left to make per element.
 *
 * @tparam Op The operation type this builder targets. Must carry a
 * reduction_operation_shape_policy.
 * @tparam KernelFactory Factory producing the reduction kernel. Invoked as
 * factory(operation, output_types, input_types), where operation is the
 * concrete @p Op and the type arguments are type_list-s of the resolved
 * element types. The returned kernel describes the fold through the members
 * @ref run_reduction_loop documents. Use default_kernel_factory for stateless
 * kernels, and fold_reduction_kernel for an operation that is no more than a
 * binary fold with a neutral element.
 * @tparam TypeDispatcher The type dispatch policy. It resolves the runtime
 * operand data types into compile-time element types. It defaults to
 * interpreting the operation's own typing rule, so a builder only names one
 * when this backend supports a narrower set of element types than the
 * operation itself allows.
 * @tparam Ordered Whether the reduced space must be traversed in the order an
 * index into it counts, which an operation reporting where it found something
 * needs and which costs it the reordering for locality. See
 * @ref reduction_layout_plan.
