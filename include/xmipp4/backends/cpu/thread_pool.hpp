/**
 * @brief A fixed set of threads a loop's iterations are spread over.
 *
 * The pool is fork-join and nothing else: @ref run publishes one job, every
 * participant claims chunks of it until there are none left, and the call
 * returns only once every chunk has finished. There is no queue, no future
 * and no way for work to outlive the call, which is what lets a program keep
 * being handed raw pointers into buffers whose lifetime ends when
 * `command_queue::submit` returns. See @ref xmipp4::command.
 *
 * The calling thread participates. A pool of no workers therefore costs
 * exactly one indirect call over running the loop inline, which is what makes
 * it safe to route every loop of the backend through it rather than only the
 * ones expected to be large.
 *
 * Work below the grain size is not split at all. The grain is stated by the
 * caller because only the caller knows what one iteration costs: an
 * elementwise iteration is one arithmetic operation, a linalg one is a whole
 * matrix product.

	 *
	 * The iteration space `[0, count)` is cut into as many contiguous chunks
	 * as there are participants, never into chunks shorter than
	 * @p grain_size, and @p body is invoked once per chunk. The partition
	 * depends only on @p count, @p grain_size and @ref get_size, never on
	 * timing; which thread runs which chunk does depend on timing.
	 *
	 * Runs the whole range inline, on the calling thread, when the pool has
	 * no worker, when the work is below one grain, and when a job is already
	 * running on this pool. That last case covers both a second host thread
	 * submitting at the same time and a body reaching this again: a job holds
	 * the pool for the whole of its duration, so a nested call finds it taken
	 * and runs itself rather than waiting for threads that are the very ones
	 * waiting on it. Nesting is therefore safe without a caller having to
	 * know it is nested.
	 *
	 * @param count Number of iterations.
	 * @param grain_size Smallest number of iterations worth handing to a
	 * thread of its own. Treated as one when zero.
	 * @param body The loop body. Invoked concurrently on one and the same
	 * object, so any state a chunk needs to itself must be created inside it.
	 * @param context Passed to @p body untouched.
	 *
	 * @throws Whatever @p body throws. Every chunk is guarded, the exception
	 * raised by the lowest numbered chunk is kept, the chunks not yet claimed
	 * are abandoned, and the exception is rethrown here, on the calling
	 * thread, once every chunk already running has finished. The pool is
	 * usable again afterwards.
