 * @brief Perform a broadcast operation between two sets of extents.

 * This operation pads the smallest set of extents with ones at the beginning. 
 * Then, both sets are iterated jointly. If both elements are equal, none of
 * them is modified. If unequal but one of them is 1, it is replaced by the
 * other. Otherwise an exception is thrown.
 * 
 * @param extents1 The first set of extents.
 * @param extents2 The second set of extents.
 * @throws std::logic_error when one of of the extents cannot be broadcasted.
