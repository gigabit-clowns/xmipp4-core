/**
 * @brief Shape policy for reductions over a set of axes.
 *
 * The inputs are broadcast together first and the reduced axes are then
 * dropped, or kept with an extent of one. Broadcasting first is what lets
 * one policy serve both a plain reduction and one taking a mask alongside
 * its operand: the mask only has to be broadcast compatible with it.
 *
 * The axes are explicit, non negative and known at construction. Reducing
 * over every axis is not a mode of this policy: it needs a rank to mean
 * anything, and the caller that has the array knows the rank, so the
 * functional layer spells it out into a list before an operation is ever
 * built. An operation is a rigid description of work, not a request to be
 * interpreted later.
