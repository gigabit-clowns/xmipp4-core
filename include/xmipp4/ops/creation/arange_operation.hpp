/**
 * @brief Write the arithmetic progression `start + i * step`.
 *
 * The operation holds the first value, the step and how many elements to
 * write, rather than the half open range a caller thinks in: where the
 * progression stops is a question about values, and answering it is what
 * fixes the length. That answer belongs to whoever asked for the range,
 * because a shape has to be known before an operand can be allocated.
 *
 * The i-th element is computed from `i` rather than from the one before
 * it, so its error does not depend on how far into the sequence it sits.
 *
 * The domain excludes the complex types: a progression needs an ordering to
 * be asked where it stops, and the complex plane has none. Use @ref
 * linspace_operation, which is told its length outright, for a complex ramp.
