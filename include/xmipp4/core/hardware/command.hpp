/**
 * @brief Specification of work to be executed on a @ref command_queue.
 *
 * A @c command binds a @ref program to its operands (outputs, inputs, and
 * scratch buffers) and is passed to @ref command_queue::submit for execution.
 * It offers a fluent interface for binding operands, allowing all three
 * binding calls to be chained in a single expression.
 *
 * This is a short-lived descriptor: it does not allocate memory. Instead, it
 * stores non-owning @ref span views over caller-managed buffer arrays. The
 * caller must ensure that every bound span and all buffers it references
 * remain valid for the entire lifetime of the @c command and until
 * @ref command_queue::submit returns.
