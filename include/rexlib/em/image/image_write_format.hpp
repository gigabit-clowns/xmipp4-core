	 * The shape is given as extents and a data type rather than as an

	 * the caller and then ignored.
	 *
	 * The extents alone do not say what is being created, since a file of
	 * @c (N,H,W) may be a stack of @c N images or one volume of @c N
	 * planes. Only the caller knows which, so it says so through
	 * @p core_rank.
	 *
	 * @param probe The file to create.
	 * @param extents Extents of the file to create, slowest axis first.
	 * @param core_rank How many trailing extents are one image or volume,
	 * the leading ones being the axes the file stacks along. Two for a
	 * stack of images, three for one volume.
	 * @param data_type Data type of its elements. A format converts to
	 * whatever it encodes, so this is what the file holds rather than what
	 * a write will supply.
	 * @param metadata How its samples map onto physical space. A format
	 * writes what of it it can carry and ignores the rest.
	 * @return std::shared_ptr<image_writer> The opened writer, never null.
	 * @throws std::invalid_argument If @p core_rank is zero or exceeds the
	 * rank of @p extents.
	 * @throws invalid_operation_error If this format can not represent the
	 * requested file, such as a rank or a data type it has no encoding for.
	 * @throws image_format_error If the file could not be created.
