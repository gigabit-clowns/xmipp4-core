/**
 * @brief CRTP base supplying the static description of an operation.
 *
 * Implements everything an operation can state once and for all: its name,
 * its arity and the names of its operands, all read from @p Traits. Both
 * policy getters are left pure, so an operation that owns a stateful policy
 * derives from this one and the compiler enforces that it provides them.
 *
 * The operand counts are exposed as compile time constants, which is what a
 * backend builder needs to size its operand arrays. They come from the
 * operation's typing rule and are checked against the operand name list, so
 * the arity cannot drift from either.
 *
 * @tparam Derived The concrete operation type. It keeps the base class type
 * distinct per operation, so that two operations sharing a rule do not
 * share a base.
 * @tparam Traits The static description. It must provide:
 *   - `static const char* get_component() noexcept`
 *   - `static const char* get_name() noexcept`
 *   - `static const operand_names<N>& get_output_names() noexcept`
 *   - `static const operand_names<M>& get_input_names() noexcept`
 *   - `using type_rule = ...`
 *
 * @see trivial_operation
 * @see operand_type_rule
