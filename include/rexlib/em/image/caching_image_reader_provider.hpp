/**
 * @brief A provider that keeps the readers it was last asked for.
 *
 * A transaction drawn at random from a set of stacks names the same few
 * files over and over, and opening one costs a system call and a header
 * read. This keeps a bounded number of them open, keyed by path, and evicts
 * the least recently asked for when it is full.
 *
 * It is a **decorator over another provider**, not a second opener: on a
 * miss it asks its backing provider and keeps what it gets. So the code that
 * turns a path into a reader stays in one place, and a cache over readers
 * that come from somewhere else entirely costs nothing to arrange. It is the
 * same shape as @ref caching_image_source over an @ref image_source.
 *
 * The capacity is a file descriptor budget, which is why it is stated in
 * entries rather than in bytes.
 *
 * @par Thread safety
 * @ref acquire may be called concurrently. The lock is not held while the
 * backing provider opens a file, so two callers missing on one path may both
 * open it and one of the two readers is kept; that wastes an open and never
 * costs correctness, since either reader serves equally. Handing out
 * @c shared_ptr means the one not kept stays alive as long as its caller
 * reads through it, and so does an evicted one.
