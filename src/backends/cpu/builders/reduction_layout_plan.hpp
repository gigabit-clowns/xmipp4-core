/**
 * @brief The iteration a reduction is run with.
 *
 * A reduction walks two spaces: the axes that survive into the output, once
 * per output element, and the axes being folded away, once per element being
 * folded. This class holds one layout for each, plus the number of elements
 * that reach every output.
 *
 * Keeping the two spaces apart is what lets the loop complete one output at a
 * time, and lets each space be ordered for its own traversal instead of
 * sharing one compromise ordering. A single layout with the output broadcast
 * over the reduced axes describes the same iteration, but sorts all the axes
 * together, which leaves the reduced ones interleaved with the kept ones in
 * an order the operation does not control.

	/**
	 * @brief Plan the iteration of a reduction over a set of axes.
	 *
	 * The inputs are broadcast together to obtain the iteration space,
	 * exactly as the reduction shape policy does when deducing the output
	 * shape, and the axes then split that space in two.
	 *
	 * The inputs are added to the kept layout before the outputs, inverting
	 * the order an elementwise operation uses. The first operand decides the
	 * axis ordering, and a reduction traverses its inputs once per folded
	 * element for every single output write, so the inputs are the operands
	 * whose locality is worth optimising.
	 *
	 * @param output_signatures Signatures of the outputs. All of them carry
	 * the shape the policy deduced, so they all belong to the kept layout.
	 * @param input_signatures Signatures of the inputs. At least one is
	 * needed.
	 * @param axes The axes being reduced, ascending and without repetitions.
	 * @param keep_dimensions Whether the outputs kept the reduced axes with
	 * an extent of one instead of dropping them.
	 * @param ordered Whether the reduced space must be traversed in a
	 * defined order, namely the one an index into it would count in: last
	 * axis fastest, as an array of the reduced extents is laid out. An
	 * operation that reports where in that space it found something cannot
	 * let the traversal be permuted for locality, so it asks for this and
	 * gives up the reordering. Adjacent axes are still merged, which
	 * preserves the order, and for an operand already laid out that way the
	 * order asked for is the locality-optimal one anyway.
	 *
	 * @throws std::invalid_argument When there is no input, when an output
	 * does not have the rank the axes and @p keep_dimensions imply, or when
	 * the inputs cannot be broadcast together.
	 * @throws std::out_of_range When an axis is not within the broadcast
	 * rank.
