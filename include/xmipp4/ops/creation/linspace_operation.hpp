/**
 * @brief Write evenly spaced samples of the segment from start to stop.
 *
 * Unlike @ref arange_operation this is told how many samples it wants and
 * works the spacing out from them, which is what makes the two complementary
 * rather than redundant: one is exact about the step and approximate about
 * the length, the other the other way round.
 *
 * When the stop is included it is written verbatim into the last element
 * rather than being left to fall out of the arithmetic, so that both ends of
 * the segment are exact whatever the spacing rounds to. A single sample has
 * no interval to span and takes the start.
 *
 * The domain is the inexact types. Evenly spaced samples of a segment are
 * generally not whole numbers, so an integer result would be a truncation
 * dressed up as a sequence; @ref arange_operation is the one that enumerates
 * integers. Complex samples are admitted: a segment of the complex plane is
 * as well defined as one of the real line.
