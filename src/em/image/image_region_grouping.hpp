/**
 * @brief Indexes regions of a transaction, ordered by the file they address.
 *
 * An @ref image_transaction_plan holds its regions in the order they were
 * added, which for a batch drawn at random is an order that hops from stack
 * to stack. A consumer wants the opposite: every region of one file
 * together, so that the file is opened once and read once. 
 *
 * It does not hold the regions, only where they are: @ref get_region maps a
 * position of the ordering to a region of the plan it was built from, which
 * the plan is then asked about. So a consumer walks one file with
 *
 * @code
 * const auto first = grouping.get_first_position(file);
 * const auto count = grouping.get_file_region_count(file);
 * for (auto i = first; i < first + count; ++i)
 * {
 *     const auto region = grouping.get_region(i);
 *     plan.get_file_offset(region);
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * @ref build costs one pass over the regions rather than a comparison sort,
 * and keeps the capacity, so one instance reused from one transaction to the
 * next allocates nothing after the first.
