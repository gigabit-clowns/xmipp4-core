/**
 * @brief Bounded associative store for backend-private resources reused
 * across operation program builds.
 *
 * The cache behaves as a typed key/value bag: each builder defines its own
 * key type and stores its own backend-specific resources (FFT plans,
 * compiled kernels, ...). Entries are partitioned by the static type of
 * the key, so unrelated builders never collide even if their key layouts
 * happen to coincide.
 *
 * The cache holds at most a fixed number of entries set at construction;
 * once that bound is reached, inserting a new entry evicts the oldest one.
 * Eviction order is shared across all key types: a hot inner bucket may
 * evict entries from a cold one.
 *
 * @par Thread safety
 * Individual calls to touch() and store() are atomic and may be issued
 * concurrently from multiple threads. The compound touch-then-store sequence
 * a builder performs on a miss is intentionally *not* atomic as a whole:
 * because the cache stores functionally interchangeable resources, two
 * threads racing on the same missing key may each build the resource and
 * store it, with one replacing the other. This wastes a build but never
 * corrupts the cache, and either stored value is equally valid.
