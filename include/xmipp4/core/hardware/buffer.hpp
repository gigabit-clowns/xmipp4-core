 * @brief Represents an untyped memory allocation at a given memory

 * A buffer is a handle to a contiguous block of memory. It carries no type 
 * information of its own Their lifetime drives the lifetime of the underlying 
 * allocation; when a buffer is destroyed, and all pending work on 
 * command_queues finishes, the allocator reclaims the memory block referenced
 * by the buffer.
 *
 * Whether the memory is reachable from the host depends on the kind of
 * the @ref memory_resource that backs the buffer. Use @ref get_host_ptr
 * to query host accessibility before dereferencing.
