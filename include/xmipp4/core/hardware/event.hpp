/**
 * @brief Abstract synchronization primitive between queues and the host.
 *
 * An @c event marks a point in a command queue's execution timeline that
 * can later be waited on or queried, either by another queue (possibly on a
 * different device) or by the host thread.
 *
 * Signaling and queue-side waiting are performed by the command queue itself,
 * via @ref command_queue::signal and @ref command_queue::wait. A newly
 * constructed event is in the signaled state. Any wait or query issued before
 * the first @ref command_queue::signal on this event completes immediately
 * and reports the event as signaled.
 *
 * @ref command_queue::signal may be invoked multiple times over the lifetime
 * of the event. Each call defines a new target point in the corresponding
 * queue's timeline and supersedes any previous one; subsequent waits and
 * queries refer to the most recently recorded point. There is no need for the
 * user to reset the event between uses; backends that require an explicit
 * reset handle it internally. The event can only be signaled from the device
 * used to create it, even if @ref event_usage_flag_bits::cross_device_wait is
 * set.
 *
 * The supported set of operations is determined at creation time by the
 * @ref event_usage_flags passed to the factory, and can be queried
 * via @ref get_supported_usage. Backends are free to pick the cheapest
 * underlying primitive that satisfies the requested capabilities; the actually
 * supported set may be a superset of the requested one. Invoking an operation
 * whose capability bit is not advertised by @ref get_supported_usage is a
 * precondition violation and yields undefined behavior.
