/**
 * @brief A provider whose files are declared and closed by their owner.
 *
 * The write side can not do what @ref caching_image_reader_provider does.
 * Creating a file replaces whatever was there, so a writer dropped and
 * reopened would truncate everything already written to it; an eviction
 * policy is therefore not a policy but a bug. What files exist and when each
 * is finished is instead said outright, through @ref declare and
 * @ref close.
 *
 * The declared files are content rather than shape — they come and go over
 * the life of a provider, so only the format manager is a constructor 
 * parameter.
 *
 * Each file therefore has one lifecycle, **declare, acquire as often as
 * needed, close**. A file is opened when it is first acquired, so declaring
 * a thousand output stacks costs no file descriptors until each is reached,
 * and @ref close is what gives them back.
 *
 * @par Thread safety
 * Every method may be called concurrently. Unlike the reading side, the lock
 * *is* held while a file is created, since two callers racing to open one
 * file would otherwise each replace it. Acquiring an already open writer
 * takes the lock only long enough to look it up.
