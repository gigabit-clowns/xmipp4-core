/**
 * @brief Scoped, configurable view over a @ref device_instance.
 *
 * A @c device_context layers the per-use, configurable state on top of the
 * immutable @ref device_instance: the @em active @ref command_queue that work
 * is submitted to, and the @ref memory_allocator selected for each
 * @ref memory_resource_affinity. 
 *
 * The context is a lightweight, copyable value with functional-update
 * semantics: @ref on_queue and @ref with_allocator do not mutate the receiver,
 * they return a modified copy. This makes a context safe to share (including
 * across threads) while still allowing callers to derive scoped variants, e.g.
 * to bind a special-purpose allocator for a single operation without disturbing
 * any other user of the original context. Copies are cheap: the instance, the
 * queue and the allocators are all shared pointers.
 *
 * @par Allocator slots
 * For a context wrapping an instance, every affinity slot always holds the
 * allocator that @ref get_allocator would return: at construction the slots are
 * seeded from the @ref device_instance allocators, and @ref with_allocator
 * either installs an override or, when given a null allocator, reverts the slot
 * back to the instance allocator.
 *
 * @par Empty state
 * A default-constructed or moved-from context is @em empty: it holds no
 * instance, no queue and no allocators. Querying it is well defined; the
 * accessors simply return null shared pointers. A populated context (one
 * constructed from a non-null instance) never returns null from any accessor.
