/**
 * @brief Pairs the hardware resources and the dispatch strategy used to run
 * operations.
 *
 * An @c execution_context bundles the two pieces of state that every
 * operation needs in order to run: a
 * @ref hardware::device_context describing @em where the work executes (the
 * device, its active @ref hardware::command_queue and its
 * @ref hardware::memory_allocator slots), and a @ref dispatcher
 * describing @em how operations are turned into device work.
 *
 * Like @ref hardware::device_context, the execution context is a lightweight,
 * copyable value with functional-update semantics: @ref with_device_context
 * and @ref with_dispatcher do not mutate the receiver, they return a
 * modified copy. This makes an execution context cheap to share (the device
 * context and the dispatcher are both held by shared pointer) while letting
 * callers derive scoped variants, e.g. to run a single operation on a
 * different queue without disturbing any other user of the original
 * execution context.
 *
 * @par Empty state
 * A default-constructed or moved-from execution context is @em empty: its
 * device context is empty (see @ref hardware::device_context) and its
 * dispatcher is null. Querying it is well defined; the accessors simply
 * return an empty device context and a null dispatcher.
