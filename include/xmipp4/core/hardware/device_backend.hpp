/**
 * @brief Abstract class that represents a hardware backend.
 *
 * A device_backend is the integration point through which a family of
 * physical or virtual compute devices (e.g. the host CPU, a vendor's GPUs)
 * is exposed to the rest of the framework. Concrete backends are typically
 * shipped as plugins and registered into a @ref device_manager, which
 * dispatches queries to the appropriate backend based on its name.
 *
 * The interface intentionally remains small: enumerating the devices that
 * the backend can see at runtime, exposing their static characteristics
 * via @ref device_properties, and instantiating a usable @ref device
 * handle on demand. Backends are non-copyable and non-movable; they are
 * meant to live behind a stable pointer owned by the @ref device_manager.
