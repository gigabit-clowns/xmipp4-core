 * @brief Where a path becomes an open @ref image_reader.
 *
 * One method, so that whether a handle is opened afresh, kept or shared is a
 * policy of the implementation rather than a fact of life for the code that
 * reads through it. A consumer names a file and gets something it can read;
 * it never learns which.
 *
 * How a path becomes a reader is deliberately not stated here either. The
 * implementations bundled with the library go through an
 * @ref image_read_format_manager, but one serving readers from a plugin, a
 * shared memory segment or a set already open fits the same interface with
 * no format manager anywhere in it.
 *
 * @par Thread safety
 * A provider may be asked for readers concurrently, since that is what a
 * transaction in flight does.
