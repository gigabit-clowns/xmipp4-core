 * @brief A pool of no workers, shared by every case that does not care.
 *
 * Keeps every loop on the calling thread, which is what most cases want: they
 * are about what a program computes, not about how many threads it computes
 * it on. Spawning none also keeps these cases off the one thing this backend
 * does that a case cannot observe, which is starting and joining threads.
 *
 * Held by shared_ptr because a @ref command_queue shares ownership of the
 * pool it runs programs over.
 *
 * @return const std::shared_ptr<thread_pool>& The pool.
