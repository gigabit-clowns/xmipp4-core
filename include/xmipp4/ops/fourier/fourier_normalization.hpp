 * @brief Which of a transform pair carries the scaling.
 *
 * A discrete Fourier transform followed by its inverse multiplies a signal by
 * the number of samples, so one of the two has to divide it back out. Which
 * one is a convention rather than a fact, and this is it.
 *
 * The convention is named rather than the factor itself so that a transform
 * and its inverse undo one another whenever they are given the same one. A
 * caller that names a factor per transform instead is left to pair the two up
 * correctly, and pairing them wrongly is silent.
 *
 * There is deliberately no "none": it would be @ref backward on a forward
 * transform and @ref forward on an inverse one, so it names no scaling that
 * cannot already be asked for, and two spellings of one operation are two
 * programs where there should be one.
