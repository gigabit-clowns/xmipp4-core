/**
 * @brief The regions transferred in one transaction.
 *
 * A transaction is what a caller submits and awaits: one array, one set of
 * files, completing as a whole. It is what an @ref image_source reads and an
 * @ref image_sink writes, where an @ref image_transfer_plan is what one
 * @ref image_reader reads and one @ref image_writer writes. The two are
 * peers describing the same thing at different scopes; neither holds the
 * other.
 *
 * Every region pairs an offset into a file with an offset into the array,
 * names which file it belongs to, and shares one set of extents with every
 * other region. The two sides are named for what they are rather than for
 * which way the data moves, so there is nothing to remember: the file side
 * is the files whatever the call does with them, and the direction belongs
 * to the call.
 *
 * The extents are the shape of one region and nothing else, so they carry
 * the rank of the region rather than the rank of either side, exactly as
 * @ref image_transfer_plan does. A side of higher rank spans a single
 * position along the axes the extents do not reach, which are its leading
 * ones.
 *
 * The shape — the extents and the two ranks — is stated when a plan is
 * constructed and never changes. A plan is therefore always one whole thing
 * rather than something to be configured before it can be used, and only the
 * files and the regions come and go.
 *
 * Every file has the same rank, since a transaction over files of differing
 * rank has no consumer and would cost the flat layout that makes this type
 * worth having: the offsets live in @ref index_table and the paths in an
 * @ref interned_path_list, so a transaction of any size costs a bounded
 * number of allocations and @ref clear keeps the capacity.
 *
 * The same rank, and nothing more. **The files may be of any size**, which
 * is the ordinary case: a dataset of twelve thousand particles spread over
 * stacks of one thousand, seven hundred and fifty, and twelve hundred is one
 * transaction like any other. A plan records the extents of no file, only
 * offsets into them, and each reader or writer bounds-checks what it is
 * given against its own file, which is the only place a file's extents are
 * known and the only place they are needed.
 *
 * What every region does share is its shape, since a plan carries one set of
 * extents. Reading whole elements therefore means those elements share a
 * core shape — which is not a restriction imposed here but what a batch is,
 * since they land in one array whose slots are one shape. Elements of
 * differing core shape are two transactions, and would be two arrays anyway.
 *
 * The regions are held in the order they were added and in no other. Walking
 * them one file at a time is what a consumer reading them wants, and
 * @ref image_region_grouping is that ordering, kept outside this class so
 * that a
 * plan is what is transferred and nothing else.
