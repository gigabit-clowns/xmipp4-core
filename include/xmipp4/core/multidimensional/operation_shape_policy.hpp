/**
 * @brief Interface describing the deduction and admissibility of array
 * shapes for an operation.
 *
 * The contract is split in two roles:
 *
 *   * `deduce` is the single source of truth: from the input shapes alone,
 *     it produces the canonical output shapes that the policy would assign,
 *     and along the way performs every input-side check the policy
 *     requires.
 *   * `accept` is invoked only when the user supplies pre-allocated
 *     outputs. It decides whether those user-supplied output shapes are
 *     admissible given the canonical ones produced by `deduce`. The
 *     default implementation requires equality with the canonical shapes;
 *     override only for policies that admit broader-but-compatible user
 *     outputs.
