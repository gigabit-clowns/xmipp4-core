 * @brief A provider that opens a file every time it is asked for one.
 *
 * It keeps nothing, so a path asked for twice is opened twice and the two
 * readers are unrelated. That is what makes it the plain one: there is no
 * capacity to size, no eviction to reason about, and a test counting how
 * often a file is opened counts exactly the calls it made.
 *
 * It is also the only reader provider in the library that knows what a
 * format is. @ref caching_image_reader_provider is a decorator over another
 * provider rather than a second opener, so the code that turns a path into a
 * reader lives here alone.
