 * Composes @ref dispatch_inner_loop_strides and

 * invoking @p kernel once per 1D vector. This is the flat building block
 * shared by CPU elementwise operation program builders.

 * strides statically resolved); it does not itself iterate the individual
 * elements. For a kernel that applies an operation once per element, use
 * @ref run_elementwise_loop instead, which builds on this function.
 *
 * The kernel is invoked as:
 * @code
 * kernel(pointers, strides, count)
 * @endcode
 * where `pointers` is a `std::tuple` of the operand pointers advanced to the
 * start of the current 1D vector, `strides` is a `std::tuple` of the
 * statically resolved inner strides (one per operand, in the same operand
 * order as `pointers`; each element is a `contiguous_stride_tag`, a
 * `broadcasting_stride_tag` or a runtime `std::ptrdiff_t`) and `count` is the
 * number of elements in the vector.

/**
 * @brief Run an elementwise loop over a layout, applying an operation once per
 * element.
 *
 * Builds on @ref run_elementwise_vector_loop by additionally applying @p op to
 * every element of each 1D vector it produces: where
 * @ref run_elementwise_vector_loop stops at vector granularity (outer-loop
 * iteration plus inner-stride dispatch, leaving the per-element application to
 * its kernel), this function also performs that per-element application. This
 * is the entry point most CPU elementwise operation program builders should
 * use.
 *
 * For each element, @p op is invoked with one pointer per operand, in the same
 * order as @p pointers:
 * @code
 * op(current0, current1, ...)
 * @endcode
 * where `currentK` points to the element of operand `K` for the current
 * iteration, i.e. its base pointer advanced by that operand's stride (for a
 * contiguous operand this is `&operandK[i]`, for a broadcasted operand it
 * stays at the first element, and for a runtime stride it is
 * `operandK + i * stride`).
 * The pointers preserve each operand's cv-qualification (mutable for outputs,
 * `const` for inputs), so @p op itself decides which operands it writes to;
 * this function draws no distinction between inputs and outputs and imposes no
 * ordering between them, so N-input/M-output operations are expressed the same
 * way as a plain unary or binary one.
 *
 * The per-element loop is specialized on the resolved strides:
 * - an all-contiguous raw indexed loop for any operand count (the
 *   vectorization-friendly fast path)
 * - a catch-all strided-iterator loop for any other stride combination. When
 *   the strides are statically known (contiguous or broadcasting tags) this
 *   loop vectorizes as well as the raw one, since the iterator carries the
 *   stride as a compile-time constant; only runtime strides fall back to
 *   scalar code.
 *
 * @tparam Op Operation invoked as `op(pointers...)` with one pointer per
 * operand, in the same order as @p pointers. May be stateful.
 * @tparam Pointers CV-qualified operand pointers, one per operand.
 * @param op The operation to be applied to every element.
 * @param layout Access layout used both for stride dispatch and for iterating
 * over the operands.
 * @param pointers The base pointer of each operand.
