/**
 * @brief CRTP base for operations owning a stateful shape policy.
 *
 * Holds the shape policy named by @p Traits by value and forwards every
 * constructor argument to it, so an operation whose shape deduction is
 * parameterised, such as a reduction over a set of axes, needs no body of
 * its own.
 *
 * This is what sets it apart from trivial_operation: the policy is a member
 * rather than a process wide singleton, so two instances of the same
 * operation may deduce different shapes. The data type policy is still the
 * shared one derived from the typing rule, because a shape parameter never
 * changes the typing.
 *
 * Only parameters belonging to the shape policy are covered. An operation
 * carrying a parameter that does not affect its shape keeps a stateless
 * policy and declares that parameter itself, as fill_operation does.
 *
 * Both policy interfaces are non copyable, so the policy is constructed in
 * place and never reassigned, and the operation is non copyable in turn.
 *
 * @tparam Derived The concrete operation type.
 * @tparam Traits The static description. In addition to what
 * basic_operation requires, it must provide `using shape_policy_type = ...`
 * naming a concrete operation_shape_policy. Unlike trivial_operation, that
 * policy needs no static `get()`.
 *
 * @see basic_operation
 * @see trivial_operation
