/**
 * @brief Generic program builder for the sequence creation family.
 *
 * Builds a CPU program that writes a one dimensional operand from nothing
 * but the position of each element. It owns the scaffolding shared by every
 * such operation: operation type check, operand-count validation, traversal
 * planning and type dispatch.
 *
 * The family is single output and takes no input. Both are checked
 * statically rather than left general: a sequence is what an operation
 * writes when it has nothing to read, and an operation writing two of them
 * at once would be two operations sharing a loop, which is a thing this
 * backend has no way to describe and no operation asking for.
 *
 * @tparam Op The operation type this builder targets.
 * @tparam KernelFactory Factory producing the generator. Invoked as
 * factory(operation, output_types, input_types), where operation is the
 * concrete @p Op and the type arguments are type_list-s of the resolved
 * element types. The returned generator is invoked once per element, with a
 * mutable pointer to the element and its position in the sequence.
 * @tparam TypeDispatcher The type dispatch policy. It resolves the runtime
 * operand data types into compile-time element types. It defaults to
 * interpreting the operation's own typing rule, so a builder only names one
 * when this backend supports a narrower set of element types than the
 * operation itself allows.
