 * @brief What every format is shown when it is asked whether it fits a file.
 *
 * A probe is built once per open and handed to each candidate format, so the
 * leading bytes of the file are read once however many formats are
 * registered, and no format opens the file just to decline it.
 *
 * It is filled when it is constructed and never changes afterwards, which is
 * what lets it be shared. A file that does not exist yields a probe with no
 * leading bytes rather than an error, since opening a file for writing
 * names a file that is not there yet and the decision then rests on the
 * extension alone.
